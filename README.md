# Exploratory Analysis on NBA Lakers Match Data

## Introduction
lakers.csv dataset contains nearly 35,000 rows of data and includes basketball match data for the Los Angeles Lakers and their opponents in 2008-2009. Hence, there is enough data to conduct a post-season review of the 2008-09 Los Angeles Lakers NBA team. Data is collected using LPS, with the location encoded with respect to a real basketball court. To conduct any meaningful analysis, a frame of reference has to be made. The whole review will be centered around shot distribution for every Lakers player, and the key question needing to be answered is: Who is the most effective shooter on this Lakers team?
